Welcome to Chat-App!

This is a simple front-end project using ReactJS.

The backend repository will be found here: https://github.com/fusion407/chat-app-backend

The backend is hosted by Onrender: https://chat-app-data.onrender.com/

The front end is on Netlify: https://fusion407-chat-app.netlify.app/

In order to fulfill this projects requirements I must:

1) Create a single page application, meaning only 1 index.html file
2) At least 5 React components must be used
3) At least 3 client-side routes using React Router
4) Use json-server to create a RESTful API
5) Add some styling

In total I have 7 React components; Home, Chat, Message, NavBar, User, Users, Login.

There are 4 different client-side routes: 
/chat  -  chatroom  
/users  -  all users  
/login  -  login page  
/  -  Home page

Json-server is being used to make POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests; fetching data from Chat, Login, and Users components and updating each props state accordingly.

Finally, styling was done mostly done by vanilla CSS, but bootstrap was also used a bit.
