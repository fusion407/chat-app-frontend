Welcome to Chat-App!

This is a simple learning project using ReactJS for my frontend, and json-server for the backend.

The backend repository will be found here: https://github.com/fusion407/chat-app-backend
The backend server is hosted by onrender

In order to fulfill this projects requirements I must:

1) Create a single page application, meaning only 1 index.html file
2) At least 5 React components must be used
3) At least 3 client-side routes using React Router
4) Use json-server to create a RESTful API
5) Add some styling

In total I have 7 React components; Chat, Home, Login, Message, NavBar, User, Users, are all children to the main App.js component.

There are 4 different client-side routes leading to
    - /chat     -    the chat room
    - /users    -    displays all users
    - /login    -    login page
    - /         -    home page

Json-server is being used to POST, GET, and DELETE data between the submitted forms and the server

Finally, styling was done mostly done by scratch CSS, but bootstrap was used to help put together the chatbox.
