Welcome to Chat-App!

This is a simple learning project using ReactJS for my frontend, and json-server for the backend.

The backend repository will be found here: https://github.com/fusion407/chat-app-backend

In order to fulfill this projects requirements I must:

Create a single page application, meaning only 1 index.html file
At least 5 React components must be used
At least 3 client-side routes using React Router
Use json-server to create a RESTful API
Add some styling
